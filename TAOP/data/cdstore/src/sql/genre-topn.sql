-- Get the N top tracks by genre
/*
* the lateral left join implements a nested loop over
* the genres and allows to fetch our Top-N tracks per
* genre, applying the order by desc limit n clause.
*
* here we choose to weight the tracks by how many
* times they appear in a playlist, so we join against
* the playlisttrack table and count appearances.
*/

/*
* the join happens in the subquery's where clause, so
* we don't need to add another one at the outer join
* level, hence the "on true" spelling.
